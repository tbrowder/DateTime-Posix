NAME
====

DateTimePosixReal - blah blah blah

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use DateTimePosixReal;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

DateTimePosixReal is a subclass of Raku's **DateTime** class that returns 'posix' values as fractional instead of integral seconds.

This module will be deprecated when Raku version 6.e is released since that version will provide the same capability for the **DateTime** base class.
