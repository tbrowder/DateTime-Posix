DateTimePosixReal - blah blah blah

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use DateTimePosixReal;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DateTimePosixReal is a subclass of Raku's B<DateTime> class that returns 'posix'
values as fractional instead of integral seconds.

This module will be deprecated when Raku version 6.e is released since that
version will provide the same capability for the B<DateTime> base class.
